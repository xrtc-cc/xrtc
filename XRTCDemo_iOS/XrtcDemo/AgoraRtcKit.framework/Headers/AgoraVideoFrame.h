/** Determines whether to receive video data from multiple channels.

 After you register the video frame observer, the SDK triggers this callback
 every time it captures a video frame.

 In the multi-channel scenario, if you want to get video data from multiple channels,
 set the return value of this callback as true. After that, the SDK triggers the
 \ref IVideoFrameObserver::onRenderVideoFrameEx "onRenderVideoFrameEx" callback to send you
 the video data from various channels. You can also get the channel ID of each video frame.

 @note
 - Once you set the return value of this callback as true, the SDK triggers only the
 `onRenderVideoFrameEx` callback to send the video frame. \ref
 IVideoFrameObserver::onRenderVideoFrame "onRenderVideoFrame" will not be triggered. In the
 multi-channel scenario, Agora recommends setting the return value as true.
 - If you set the return value of this callback as false, the SDK triggers only the
 `onRenderVideoFrame` callback to send the video data.
 @return
 - `true`: Receive video data from multiple channels.
 - `false`: Do not receive video data from multiple channels.
